# Python
Road to learning python


I am learning Python from a Youtube channel


Some of the programs are copy pasted that doesnt mean I havent tried them I was just too lazy to add comments :)
So after trying them out I copy pastes some of the programs 

Currently I am also referring "THINK PYTHON" by Allen B. Downey
